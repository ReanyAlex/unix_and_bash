# unix_and_bash

Learn how to navigate your UNIX system like a pro and write scripts with the popular bash scripting language. If you’d like to learn more about how to interact with your operating system and automate common tasks, this is a good goal for you.

## Context

The *nix family of operating systems (that is, anything in the UNIX or Linux families, like Mac OS X or Ubuntu) are the most popular in the world of web development. Whether you are looking to be able to use and navigate your own local system or a remote server, knowing the basic commands is really important.

Then you have the shell. Bash is a common one that ships with all Apple computers, but there are others: zsh, csh, and fish (yes, it’s called fish). While this goal only focuses on bash, you may be inspired to try out other shells.
