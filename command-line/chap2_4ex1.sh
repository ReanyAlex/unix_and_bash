echo "FRom faireſt creatures we deſire increaſe,
> That thereby beauties Roſe might neuer die,
> But as the riper ſhould by time deceaſe,
> His tender heire might beare his memory:
> But thou contracted to thine owne bright eyes,
> Feed’ſt thy lights flame with ſelfe ſubſtantiall fewell,
> Making a famine where aboundance lies,
> Thy ſelfe thy foe,to thy ſweet ſelfe too cruell:
> Thou that art now the worlds freſh ornament,
> And only herauld to the gaudy ſpring,
> Within thine owne bud burieſt thy content,
> And tender chorle makſt waſt in niggarding:
>    Pitty the world,or elſe this glutton be,
>    To eate the worlds due,by the graue and thee." > sonnet_1_complete.txt
