#ake a copy of the two files script1.sh and script2.sh
#above then experiment by tweaking them and running them
#and observing the output. This will help you get a feel
#for how exporting variables works

#!/bin/bash
# demonstrate variable scope 1.
#var1=blah
#var2=foo
# Let's verify their current value
#echo $0 :: var1 : $var1, var2 : $var2

#./script2.sh
# Let's see what they are now
#echo $0 :: var1 : $var1, var2 : $var2

#!/bin/bash
# demonstrate variable scope 2
# Let's verify their current value
#echo $0 :: var1 : $var1, var2 : $var2
# Let's change their values
#var1=flop
#var2=bleh


#Played around with the variables to get a better sense of scope
